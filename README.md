*Have you ever wanted to build and deploy a website to the cloud without needing to install a bunch of tools and SDKs on your computer? If yes, then come to this fast-paced workshop where you'll choose your own adventure and programming language (JavaScript, C#, Java, or Python) and then plan, build and deploy a web app with GitHub Issues, Codespaces, and Copilot to Microsoft Azure using GitHub Actions.*
